<!-- GETTING STARTED -->
## Getting Started


To view the dashboard in its entirety you will need to download the following. 

1) Assets folder
2) OnlineRetail.csv.zip
3) app.py

or clone the repository 
```sh
git clone https://github.com/futious/Online-Retail-Dashboard.git
```


After you have downloaded all of these items and opened the zip file run the python code. The dashboard will run locally and requires you to use your internet browser to see it. Input http://127.0.0.1:8070 into your browser and the dashboard will populate only after the code has been run.



  ---
### Installation

To run the code you may need to download dash in your terminal using 

   ```sh
   pip install dash
   ```
